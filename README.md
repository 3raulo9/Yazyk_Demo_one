# Yazyk Demo One

Welcome to the first demo of my language learning website, Yazyk. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the website on your local machine.

## Setup

### Creating the Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use.

#### Step 1: Install Virtual Environment

First, you need to install the virtual environment. Here's how you can do it:

\`\`\`bash
$ pip install virtualenv
\`\`\`

#### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

\`\`\`bash
$ virtualenv <name_of_virtualenv>
\`\`\`

Replace `<name_of_virtualenv>` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment. You can name it anything you like.

#### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

You can activate the virtual environment using this command:

\`\`\`bash
$ source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate
\`\`\`

Now, you have successfully created and activated the virtual environment. You can now proceed to install the necessary Python packages for your project.

Happy coding!
